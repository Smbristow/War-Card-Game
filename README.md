# Cards at War
### Cards at War is an update on the classic card game War. The game is played by clicking the player card decks to flip cards with the highest card value determining the round winner. The round winner takes all the cards that were flipped during that turn. If the values are the same War occurs in which players each flip two more cards with the highest of the last flipped card being the winner of the war and taking all cards flipped. The game ends when one player has collected all the cards.
